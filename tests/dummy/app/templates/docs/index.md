# Introduction

Event scheduler is a powerful scheduling calendar that helps you to manage your events for multiple resources(people, projects, etc.,) in a much simpler and elegant way.

## Why does this exist?

Dispatching and scheduling the events based on the resourceâ€™s availability can become a nightmare over a period of time. We need to ensure workloads are optimized and events are assigned to the right resource at right time and ensure there are no conflicting events.

## Declarative
Most of your scheduling needs can be satisfied with just a few lines of handlebars and some actions. By using the ember tools we love so much, you can stop worrying about managing the events, and focus on building your application. This is especially true for the more complex features, like displaying multi-day events and auot-positioning the conflicting events.

## Composable
Contextual components make it easy to create and build up your event scheduler. Together with the basic `{{each}}` and `{{if}}` helpers, you can create the bulk of your scheduler without a drop of JavaScript.
